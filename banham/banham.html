        <b>ABSTRACT</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        In this paper, I will try and shed a new light on the canonical mid-20th century British historian Reyner Banham in an attempt to make the claim that Reyner Banham was a fundamentally post-modern thinker. That, despite his explicit and vehement repeated claims for a technologically focused architectural discipline, the episteme he inhabited was a post- modern one which did not resemble his modern predecessors such as Nikolaus Pevsner, but more resembled that of his contemporaries and successors such as Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown - that in fact, it may have been Banham's critique of modernism that led to the post-modern thesis.
        <br><br>
        Reyner Banham was an incredible critic of architecture who wrote extensively on modernism, well-tempered environments and the relationship between architecture and technology. This led to him having the reputation of a crusader of high-tech architecture and modernism and he was typically known as an arch critic of the post-modern movement in architecture. Common literature on Banham says as such - including Anthony Vidler's Histories of the Immediate Present, Nigel Whitley's Historian of the Immediate Futureas well as Todd Gannon's Paradoxes of High Tech. Banham in these cases is usually portrayed as a techno-focused advocate of machine aesthetics and technology's primordial role - which makes him seem as an extension of the modern movement in architecture.
        <br><br>
        However, it's Banham's very radical stance that makes him a post-modern thinker. Banham's focus on technology's role in architecture inevitably led to his conclusion that technology had made the tradition of architecture defunct, and that the world could now dispose off these garments of architecture. Banham allowed for architecture to be seen as garments, as mere robes worn by buildings. This duality - between architectural representation and its inherent function was also the basis for the postmodern movement - for Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown to argue for architecture as a communicative medium, wearing signs and symbols.
        <br><br>
        Hopefully, this will prove to be a new reading of Banham and situate him more appropriately in his temporal and spatial context - changing how we think of Banham's relationship to his contemporaries.
